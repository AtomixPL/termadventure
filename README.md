# TermAdventure
A small Python console game where you travel through a lot of directories and find various things.

This is my second Python game and it's based on the original ProgressDOS minigame from Progressbar95. It's slightly different and it makes you feel you're exploring an Linux system. This game took me about 1 month to create from my knowledge of Python (sometimes i needed chatgpt). All you need to do is to collect as many bonuses as you can while exploring directories. You can also find codes inside readme files for various code programs, which can give you a lot of points. To finish the game, you need to get to the 50th directory. It is not the final product yet, there's still a lot to improve and add into the game. To launch the game, run it with Python if you have it installed.
## Navigating the system
While exploring the system **you cannot go back by one directory** until you will find an empty one. Remember to always claim bonuses when you'll encounter them, otherwise they will be gone.
### Available commands
_ls_ - list directories

_cd (dir)_ - change directory

_cd .._ - leave the directory

_cat (text file)_ - read the content of the text file

_(executable)_ - run the program or claim bonus

_su root_ - switch to the root user (if you know the password)
## Bonuses, eastereggs and unknown files
Bonuses are common executables that can give you from 1 000 to 5 000 points. Eastereggs are less common, and they are worth 10 000 points. However unknown files are more dangerous, they can ~~steal your points or~~ delete your whole system, and this is where the game ends. But rarely they can give you some points.
## Readme files
Inside those text files there are random contents written, but you can encounter mysterious codes, which can hint to more worthy and interesting programs, that can contain up to ~~1 000 000~~ 30 000 points. They can only appear after finding such codes.
## Kernelcode, codex, ~~hex and emulator~~
Kernelcode is an executable where you must type in correct 3-digit code which you can find in the text file beginning with the Linux kernel version. By successfully solving the program you can get 20 000 points. Codex is an extrordinary latin program, which works the same as kernelcode, but you need to know numbers in latin. When you'll encounter a readme file with "lorem ipsum" text inside it, there are numbers written in latin below, eg. unus, duo, tres etc. By correctly typing the 3-digit code as in kernelcode you can get 30 000 points.
